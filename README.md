PrimeMirrorProgram
==================

Program that checks if a prime has a mirror prime. If the position of the prime and the mirror prime in the prime order 
are mirrors and if the prime in binary is a palindrome.

The program was written as an exercise in the Ruby programming language, but also to test if there were any other numbers
like Sheldon Coopers favorite number - 73. I have run the program for the first 1M primes so far, but haven't found
one like 73 yet.
